# Alicorn: The Found

## IMPORTANT

This project was archived since the framework (NeutralinoJS) has a problem related to process spawning.

It's impossible for us to build a launcher without spawning any processes, so that's it, the story ends earlier than I thought. Also, I don't have plans to switch to another framework.

Files are kept as the rememberance of our effort. Thanks everyone.

## Why Again A Minecraft Launcher?

Well, this is not only a launcher.

As a launcher, it is missing many functionalities, and there is no plan to add them.

Wha's more important is that this is my last work for Minecraft. If you want to know more details, jump to the end of the README.

## No Issues

Unless there are severe security issues, all issues will be closed.

After version 1.0, we won't release updates for new features. If a future Minecraft profile cannot be launched, we might release patches to fix. If great changes take place, we might response, but no promises.

If you want some features, open issues in [Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn), they might be resolved by our collaborators. Or, easier, use another launcher. Do it, I won't be mad.

## Farewell

Our life used to be easy, but as time passes, thing just starting to get weird.

I'm not targeting at Netease or Microsoft, I do not hate them, instead, without them, Minecraft won't be Minecraft. They are heros, indeed.

It's our communities that went on the wrong way.

Since when have players started to get used to play on offline mode?

Since when have commercial servers begun to ignore EULA?

Since when have the mods been used to get money?

Since when have the launchers even begun to charge?

Minecraft communities has long been wrong, and there is nothing I can do. I've really tried, I swear. I love Minecraft, so I'm afarid of losing my passion for it.

But I have already lost it.

So I named my last launcher _The Found_. I used the name of _Alicorn_, just to remember my best work.

I'm going to leave and find another thing to do, perhaps drawing? I don't know, but I've already downloaded Krita, maybe that's my love.

Who knows?

Ah, but still thanks for your reading. If you want, will you take over my unfinished plan?
